## [1.1.1] - 2025-03-10

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where you'd open a collapsable, open another station modal and collapsibles would bug out. Android + IOS Fix.
- Partially fixed Metro Stations bug (manually removed some, added a new filtering tehnique) - can be fixed in the future by only implementing STB stations from GTFS, but would remove other agencies too, like STV, STCM and REGIO SERV TRANSPORT.
